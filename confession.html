    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>Hello! I have something to tell you.</p>
    <p>
      I am writing this letter to confess my feelings towards you. Yes, I was scared at first, and I am not used to doing this kind of thing. But somehow, I realized that if I do not voice out my feelings for you, I might regret it for a lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know that I am not your type, standard, or ideal guy. But I would cross the ocean and climb the highest mountain just to be with you. This might sound cringe, but I have never felt this spark for a long time. Whenever I look at you, my heart freezes like an iceberg, and whenever I make eye contact with you, my heart melts. Before, I thought that love at first sight was absurd—but here I am, experiencing it for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I deeply admire you for being a kind and helpful person. I can see that you have a good personality within you. You inspire and motivate me to go to work even on my worst days. One smile and one laugh from you wash my tiredness away. I might not be brave enough to talk to you personally, but stolen glances at you complete my day. Anyway, I just want you to know that I like you.
